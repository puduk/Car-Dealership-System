## 📌 Reason for Loss
Accidentally deleted during a Linux distro switch. While organizing my local project folders, I mistakenly erased the entire directory containing this project.


## 💡 Project Summary
This was one of my most detailed C++ projects — around the same scale and complexity as my Puduk Eats project (3300+ lines).
It included features like:

* Add / Remove / Rent / Sell Cars

* File-based storage system (TXT-based database)

* User account system (Sign up / Sign in)

* Password recovery logic

* Sales analytics (simple charts via terminal)

* Dynamic memory usage with pointers

* Multi-page menu navigation with keyboard shortcuts


## 📝 Future Plans
Currently, I don’t have the time to recreate it, but I plan to rebuild the entire system within 1–2 months.
This time, I will also:

* Add a Qt-based GUI for a more professional look and usability

* Optimize code structure using OOP principles

* Include proper documentation and unit testing
